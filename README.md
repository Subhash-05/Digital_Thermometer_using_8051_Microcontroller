# Digital_Thermometer_using_8051_Microcontroller
The Digital Thermometer using 8051 Microcontroller measures temperature with an LM35 sensor, converts the signal via ADC0804, and displays the result on a 16x2 LCD. Programmed in Embedded C and tested on Keil and Proteus, it offers a simple, low-cost, and reliable real-time temperature monitoring system.
